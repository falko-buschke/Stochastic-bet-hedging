## 1. Introduction

This archive contains the R script used for the following study:
	
*  Pinceel, T., Vanschoenwinkel, B., Brendonck, L. & Buschke, F.T. (unpublished). Modelling the sensitivity of life history traits to climate change in a temporary 
pool crustacean . 

A written description of the research methodology can be obtained from the manuscript. Any comments or inquiries can be directed to Falko Buschke 
(`falko.buschke@gmail.com`).

While the code have been thoroughly tested, we acknowledge that it is by no means perfect. The contents of these files were last verified on 09 February 2016.

These files contain pseudo-code in that they are annotated and complete to the extent that they can be used to replicate the results of the aforementioned study. 
However, they are incomplete in the sense that they cannot recreate the research outputs 100% in their unmodified form. For instance, the study included sensitivity analyses and the estimate of extinction risk, but these analyses require further calculations on the output of this script..  


## 2. Overview of files

There is only a single file (`Stochastic_bet-hedging.r`) which contains a fully annotated R-script with all the commands necessary to simulate the hydrological regime of rock pools using a log-normal approximation and then the population dynamics of the fairy shrimp based on the reprodcutive suitability of each filling-drying cycle.
